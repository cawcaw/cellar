# CELLÎ›R

Multisite mustache hosting.
Currently deep beta and actively developed.

### First steps.


Install the gem:
``` shell
gem install cellar
```

And make Cellar application:
``` shell
cellar new cellapp
````

These two simple steps will create a platform for hosting many sites at once.

For reference, see in cellapp/sites/example

### Confyg and start.


Now you need to check config/database.yml and enable your favorite gems in Gemfile:
``` ruby
# # please, uncoment gems that you want to use
# gem 'coffee-script'
# gem 'sass'
# gem 'less'
# gem 'therubyracer' # dependent for Less
```

After this install bundle and create database:
``` shell
cd cellapp
bundle
rake db:reset
```

I re commend use http://pow.cx, but you can just start with Thin:
``` shell
bundle exec thin start
```
